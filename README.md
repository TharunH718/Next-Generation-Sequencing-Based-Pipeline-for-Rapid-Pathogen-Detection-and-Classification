# Next-Generation-Sequencing-Based-Pipeline-for-Rapid-Pathogen-Detection-and-Classification

## Project Overview
This project provides an automated bioinformatics workflow using Snakemake for the rapid detection and classification of pathogens from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. It streamlines the entire analysis from raw sequencing reads to interactive visualizations, making complex genomic analysis more accessible for clinical diagnostics, public health surveillance, and research.
